abstract="In this lecture the group of rigid body motions is introduced via its representation on standard three dimensional Euclidian space. The relevance for robotics is that the links of a robot are usually modelled as rigid bodies. Moreover the payload of a robot is also usually a rigid body and hence much of robotics is concerned with understanding rigid transformations and sequences of these transformations. Chasles's theorem is presented, that is: a general rigid body motion is a screw motion, a rotation about a line in space followed by a translation along the line.",

    abstract = { Grasping has always been a great challenge for robots due to its lack of the ability to well understand the perceived sensing data. In this work, we propose an end-to-end deep vision network model to predict possible good grasps from real-world images in real time. In order to accelerate the speed of the grasp detection, reference rectangles are designed to suggest potential grasp locations and then refined to indicate robotic grasps in the image. With the proposed model, the graspable scores for each location in the image and the corresponding predicted grasp rectangles can be obtained in real time at a rate of 80 frames per second on a graphic processing unit. The model is evaluated on a real robot-collected data set and different reference rectangle settings are compared to yield the best detection performance. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can assist the robot to learn the graspable part of the object from the image in a fast manner. }
